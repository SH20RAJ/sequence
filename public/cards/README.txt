Card Images for Sequence Game

This directory should contain images for all 52 playing cards in the format:
[value]_[suit].png

Examples:
- A_hearts.png
- K_spades.png
- 10_diamonds.png
- 2_clubs.png

Additionally, a card back image named 'card-back.png' is needed.

For a complete implementation, you'll need to add all these images.
You can find free card images online or create your own.
